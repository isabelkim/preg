To get to the website, make sure Flask is installed, run the command “flask run” in your terminal, and click the link that shows up. 

To use our website, you must register as a user by entering a username and password on our register page. Registering then leads you to the log-in page, where you can log in to your account and gain access to the various components of our website, shown by our navigation bar. 

Our website gives the user the ability to keep a journal throughout their pregnancy. You can submit journal entries on the “Submit Entry” page by entering a title, entry, and mood, and you will be able to look through all of the journal entries you created on the “Journal” page. 

The user also has the ability to track the growth of the baby using our tracking page. To be able to track the development of your fetus, you must first enter an approximate conception date on the “Conception” page. If you try to access the “Tracking” page without having previously entered a conception date, you will be redirected to an error/apology page. Once you’ve successfully entered a conception date, on the “Tracking” page, you will see a description of what the baby’s development is like at that point in time, depending on how long it has been since that date of conception. 

If you click on “PPD,” you’ll be led to a page of information on postpartum depression, which provides the user with a general description of postpartum depression and links to resources for people who may be struggling with postpartum depression. Finally, if you click “Quiz,” you’ll be taken to a Buzzfeed-style quiz that’ll sort the user’s baby into a Harry Potter house based on their Annenberg meal choices.
